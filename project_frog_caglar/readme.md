The code is written in C# programming language. It is a console-based game with basic graphics. The game consists of a frog that the player controls and tries to cross the road without getting hit by cars. The game has four lanes where cars move from left to right with random speeds. The code initializes the positions, speed, and length of cars randomly. The player can move the frog up, down, left, and right using arrow keys. The game ends if the frog gets hit by a car or if it crosses all four lanes safely.
